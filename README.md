# ros2_gazebo_mestrado — Agrobot simulation

ROS 2 workspace for **Agrobot**, a 4-wheel skid-steer agricultural robot, simulated in
**Webots** (main path, with Nav2 navigation) and **Gazebo Harmonic** (earlier path,
reactive obstacle avoidance and stability tests).

- ROS 2 **Jazzy** (Ubuntu 24.04, running under WSL2)
- Webots **R2025a**, installed on Windows (`WEBOTS_HOME=/mnt/c/Program Files/Webots`)
  and driven from WSL by `webots_ros2_driver` 2025.0.0
- Nav2 (`ros-jazzy-navigation2` 1.3.x)

## Current state

| Feature | Simulator | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Drive the robot with `/cmd_vel` | Webots | Works |
| Wheel + IMU odometry (`/odom`, TF `odom → base_link`) | Webots | Works |
| Low front lidar (`/scan`) that sees the crates and boxes | Webots | Works |
| Nav2: click a goal in RViz and the robot drives there around obstacles | Webots | Works, tested on 2026-10-02 |
| Mapping / SLAM / AMCL / GPS | — | Not done. Navigation happens in the `odom` frame |
| `cmd_vel` / `odom` / `scan` bridge | Gazebo | Works (from the earlier commits) |
| Reactive obstacle avoidance node | Gazebo | Code exists, but see [Known issues](#known-issues) |
| Roll/pitch stability monitor | Gazebo | Code exists, no entry point yet |

The Webots + Nav2 work is **not committed yet** (see `git status`).

## Setup

### Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-webots-ros2 ros-jazzy-navigation2 ros-jazzy-rviz2 \
                 ros-jazzy-robot-state-publisher ros-jazzy-ros-gz
```

Webots runs on Windows. `webots_ros2_driver` finds it through `WEBOTS_HOME`, so that
variable must point to the Windows install (`/mnt/c/Program Files/Webots`). The
`$env:IPAddress` line in [utils/commands.md](utils/commands.md) is the PowerShell side of
that WSL ↔ Windows connection.

### Build

```bash
cd ~/projects/ros2_gazebo_mestrado
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install            # or: --executor sequential on low-RAM machines
source install/setup.bash
```

Rebuild `agrobot_webots` after editing anything in it. The launch files read the
**installed** copies of the world, PROTO, params and RViz config from
`install/agrobot_webots/share/...`.

## Running (Webots + Nav2)

```bash
ros2 launch agrobot_webots simulation.launch.py
```

This starts Webots with `obstacle_arena.wbt`, the Agrobot driver plugin,
`robot_state_publisher`, the Nav2 servers and RViz. Closing Webots shuts the whole launch
down.

Launch arguments:

| Argument | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `nav` | `true` | Start the Nav2 servers (`navigation.launch.py`) |
| `rviz` | `true` | Start RViz with `rviz/nav.rviz` |

Examples:

```bash
ros2 launch agrobot_webots simulation.launch.py nav:=false rviz:=false   # robot only
ros2 launch agrobot_webots navigation.launch.py                          # Nav2 alone, in another terminal
```

### Sending a goal

- **RViz:** use the **Nav2 Goal** tool in the toolbar and click-drag on the grid. The fixed
  frame is `odom`.
- **CLI:**
  ```bash
  ros2 action send_goal /navigate_to_pose nav2_msgs/action/NavigateToPose \
    "{pose: {header: {frame_id: odom}, pose: {position: {x: 1.5, y: 1.0}, orientation: {w: 1.0}}}}"
  ```

Goal coordinates are in `odom`. **`odom` = where the robot spawned** (world position
`(-1.0, -0.3)`, facing +x), not the center of the arena. The walls are at world ±2.5 m, so
in `odom` the free space runs roughly from x = -1.5 to 3.5 and y = -2.2 to 2.8, minus the
robot's half-width (~0.56 m).

### Manual driving

```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard        # with nav:=false
ros2 topic pub -r 10 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.3}}"
```

When Nav2 is running, `velocity_smoother` also publishes on `/cmd_vel`. Use `nav:=false`
for manual driving.

### Useful checks

```bash
ros2 topic hz /scan                     # ~10 Hz
ros2 topic echo /odom --once
ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames          # odom -> base_link -> wheels, front_lidar_link, ...
ros2 lifecycle get /bt_navigator        # should be "active [3]"
```

## Webots architecture

```
                 Webots (Windows)
                      │  extern controller
            webots_ros2_driver  ──loads plugin──►  AgrobotDriver (agrobot_driver.py)
                                                     │ subscribes /cmd_vel
                                                     │ publishes  /odom, TF odom→base_link,
                                                     │            /scan, /joint_states

```

### Topics and frames

| Topic | Type | Publisher | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/cmd_vel` | `geometry_msgs/Twist` | velocity_smoother / you | `linear.x`, `angular.z` only |
| `/odom` | `nav_msgs/Odometry` | AgrobotDriver | wheel distance + IMU yaw |
| `/scan` | `sensor_msgs/LaserScan` | AgrobotDriver | frame `front_lidar_link`, 300 rays, 3.0 rad FOV, 0.1–8 m, sensor-data QoS |
| `/joint_states` | `sensor_msgs/JointState` | AgrobotDriver | 4 wheel positions |
| `/tf` | | AgrobotDriver, robot_state_publisher | `odom → base_link` is dynamic, the rest is static |

All messages are stamped with **Webots simulation time** (`robot.getTime()`), and every
node runs with `use_sim_time: true`.

### Robot parameters

Set in the URDF `<webots><plugin>` block ([agrobot.urdf](agrobot_description/urdf/agrobot.urdf)):

| Property | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `wheelRadius` | 0.22 m | |
| `wheelSeparation` | 0.96 m | geometric track width |
| `wheelSeparationScale` | 1.33 | effective track = 0.96 × 1.33, calibrated for skid-steer slip in turns |

Sensors in the PROTO ([agrobot.proto](agrobot_webots/protos/agrobot.proto)):
- `InertialUnit` named `imu` (gives the odometry yaw)
- `Lidar` named `front_lidar` at (0.65, 0, -0.15) from `base_link`, about 0.14 m above the
  floor, so it sees the 0.2 m boxes and 0.3 m crates

### Nav2 configuration (summary)

[config/nav2_params.yaml](agrobot_webots/config/nav2_params.yaml):
- No map. `global_frame: odom` everywhere. Both costmaps are rolling windows (local 4×4 m,
  global 12×12 m, 5 cm cells).
- Layers: `obstacle_layer` (from `/scan`) + `inflation_layer` (radius 0.7 m).
- Footprint 1.2 × 1.12 m (chassis length × outer wheel width).
- Planner: NavFn. Controller: Regulated Pure Pursuit, 0.4 m/s, rotate-to-heading on.
- Goal tolerance: 0.15 m / 0.3 rad.
- Limits (velocity_smoother): 0.5 m/s forward, 0.3 m/s reverse, 1.0 rad/s.

## Running (Gazebo, earlier work)

```bash
ros2 launch agrobot_gazebo simulation.launch.py   # obstacle_arena_world.sdf + spawn + bridge
ros2 launch vineyard_gazebo_world small.launch.py # vineyard world (spawn the robot separately)
ros2 launch agrobot_description spawn_agrobot.launch.py
```

In Gazebo, the robot uses the `gz-sim-diff-drive-system` plugin and the tall `lidar_link`
`gpu_lidar` from the same URDF. The Webots-only parts of the URDF (`<webots>` block,
`front_lidar_link`) don't affect Gazebo.

## Known issues

- **Odometry drift.** Skid-steer wheels slip sideways in turns, and the encoders can't
  see it. Expect about 0.3 m position error per goal and about 0.4 m after a round trip.
  Fix: fuse IMU acceleration with `robot_localization`, or add GPS/AMCL/SLAM.
- **`odom` is relative to the spawn point.** Goals don't refer to fixed world positions.
  Moving the spawn pose in the `.wbt` moves the whole goal frame.
- **Orphan Nav2 processes.** If you kill `ros2 launch` with SIGKILL, leftover nodes (e.g.
  `lifecycle_manager`) deactivate the next run's nodes. Before relaunching, run:
  `pkill -9 -f nav2_`
- **World/PROTO version mismatch.** `obstacle_arena.wbt` is `R2023a`, the PROTO is
  `R2025a`. It loads in the installed Webots, but Webots may ask to convert the world.
- **`agrobot_control` won't run as is.** `obstacle_avoidance.py` and
  `stability_monitor.py` sit in the package root, not in the `agrobot_control/` Python
  module, so the `obstacle_avoidance` entry point can't import them. `stability_monitor`
  has no entry point. Fix: move both into `agrobot_control/agrobot_control/` and add the
  missing entry point.
- **`stability_simulation.launch.py`** uses the relative world path
  `agrobot_gazebo/stability_test_world.sdf`, so it only works when started from the repo
  root.
- **Committed `__pycache__/` files.** Add `__pycache__/` to `.gitignore` and `git rm --cached` them.

## Next steps

1. Better localization: `robot_localization` EKF (wheel odom + IMU), then GPS or
   SLAM/AMCL with a `map` frame.
2. Move the Nav2 setup to the vineyard world (rows, longer distances).
3. Fix the `agrobot_control` package layout. Decide whether the reactive avoider is still
   needed alongside Nav2.
4. Fill in `package.xml` descriptions and licenses.

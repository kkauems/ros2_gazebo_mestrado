# ros2_gazebo_mestrado — Agrobot simulation

ROS 2 workspace for **Agrobot**, a 4-wheel skid-steer agricultural robot, simulated in
**Webots** (main path, with Nav2 navigation) and **Gazebo Harmonic** (earlier path,
reactive obstacle avoidance and stability tests).

- ROS 2 **Jazzy** (Ubuntu 24.04, running under WSL2)
- Webots **R2025a**, installed on Windows (`WEBOTS_HOME=/mnt/c/Program Files/Webots`)
  and driven from WSL by `webots_ros2_driver` 2025.0.0
- Nav2 (`ros-jazzy-navigation2` 1.3.x)

## Current state

| Feature | Simulator | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Drive the robot with `/cmd_vel` | Webots | Works |
| Wheel + IMU odometry (`/odom`, TF `odom → base_link`) | Webots | Works |
| Low front lidar (`/scan`) that sees the crates and boxes | Webots | Works |
| Nav2: click a goal in RViz and the robot drives there around obstacles | Webots | Works, tested on 2026-10-02 |
| Goal from RViz without Nav2 or map: odometry only, avoids what is in front (`goal_navigator`) | Webots | New on 2026-10-06, tested only in a 2D Python simulation |
| `robot_localization` EKF (wheels + IMU) as the `/odom` source, `ekf:=true` | Webots | New on 2026-10-07, tested with Nav2 against a Python stand-in for Webots, not yet in Webots |
| `/clock` from Webots sim time | Webots | New on 2026-10-07 |
| Mapping / SLAM / AMCL / GPS / VSLAM | — | Not done. Navigation happens in the `odom` frame. VSLAM study: [claude/estudo_vslam.md](claude/estudo_vslam.md) |
| `cmd_vel` / `odom` / `scan` bridge | Gazebo | Works (from the earlier commits) |
| Reactive obstacle avoidance node | Gazebo | Code exists, but see [Known issues](#known-issues) |
| Roll/pitch stability monitor | Gazebo | Code exists, no entry point yet |

The Webots + Nav2 work is **not committed yet** (see `git status`).

## Setup

### Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-webots-ros2 ros-jazzy-navigation2 ros-jazzy-rviz2 \
                 ros-jazzy-robot-state-publisher ros-jazzy-robot-localization ros-jazzy-ros-gz
```

Webots runs on Windows. `webots_ros2_driver` finds it through `WEBOTS_HOME`, so that
variable must point to the Windows install (`/mnt/c/Program Files/Webots`). The
`$env:IPAddress` line in [utils/commands.md](utils/commands.md) is the PowerShell side of
that WSL ↔ Windows connection.

### Build

```bash
cd ~/projects/ros2_gazebo_mestrado
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install            # or: --executor sequential on low-RAM machines
source install/setup.bash
```

Rebuild `agrobot_webots` after editing anything in it. The launch files read the
**installed** copies of the world, PROTO, params and RViz config from
`install/agrobot_webots/share/...`.

## Running (Webots + Nav2)

```bash
ros2 launch agrobot_webots simulation.launch.py
```

This starts Webots with `obstacle_arena.wbt`, the Agrobot driver plugin,
`robot_state_publisher`, the Nav2 servers and RViz. Closing Webots shuts the whole launch
down.

Launch arguments:

| Argument | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `nav` | `true` | Start the Nav2 servers (`navigation.launch.py`) |
| `rviz` | `true` | Start RViz with `rviz/nav.rviz` |
| `ekf` | `false` | `true`: the `robot_localization` EKF fuses `/wheel/odom` + `/imu/data` and publishes `/odom` and TF `odom → base_link` (the driver stops publishing them). `goal_navigation.launch.py` takes the same argument |

Examples:

```bash
ros2 launch agrobot_webots simulation.launch.py ekf:=true                 # Nav2 on the EKF odometry
ros2 launch agrobot_webots simulation.launch.py nav:=false rviz:=false   # robot only
ros2 launch agrobot_webots navigation.launch.py                          # Nav2 alone, in another terminal
```

### Sending a goal

- **RViz:** use the **Nav2 Goal** tool in the toolbar and click-drag on the grid. The fixed
  frame is `odom`.
- **CLI:**
  ```bash
  ros2 action send_goal /navigate_to_pose nav2_msgs/action/NavigateToPose \
    "{pose: {header: {frame_id: odom}, pose: {position: {x: 1.5, y: 1.0}, orientation: {w: 1.0}}}}"
  ```

Goal coordinates are in `odom`. **`odom` = where the robot spawned** (world position
`(-1.0, -0.3)`, facing +x), not the center of the arena. The walls are at world ±2.5 m, so
in `odom` the free space runs roughly from x = -1.5 to 3.5 and y = -2.2 to 2.8, minus the
robot's half-width (~0.56 m).

### Goal without Nav2 (`goal_navigator`)

```bash
ros2 launch agrobot_webots goal_navigation.launch.py     # rviz:=false to skip RViz
```

Same Webots world and driver, but no Nav2 and no costmaps. In RViz (Fixed Frame `odom`),
pick **2D Goal Pose** and click-drag on the grid. The `goal_navigator` node drives
towards the goal using only `/odom`. The lidar is only used to check whether the strip in
front of the robot (its width plus a margin) is free. If the way to the goal is blocked, it
takes the free direction closest to the goal and heads for the goal again once that way
opens. It keeps the lidar points it saw near the robot for a while, because the front lidar
can't see the sides of the body, and checks them before every turn so the body doesn't
hit anything. It stops with a log message when it can't get closer to the goal for 40 s,
or when it is boxed in and can't turn or maneuver for 5 s ("Robô cercado").
Details and parameters: [claude/manual.md](claude/manual.md).

### Manual driving

```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard        # with nav:=false
ros2 topic pub -r 10 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.3}}"
```

When Nav2 is running, `velocity_smoother` also publishes on `/cmd_vel`. Use `nav:=false`
for manual driving.

### Useful checks

```bash
ros2 topic hz /scan                     # ~10 Hz
ros2 topic echo /odom --once
ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames          # odom -> base_link -> wheels, front_lidar_link, ...
ros2 lifecycle get /bt_navigator        # should be "active [3]"
```

### Topics and frames

| Topic | Type | Publisher | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/cmd_vel` | `geometry_msgs/Twist` | velocity_smoother / you | `linear.x`, `angular.z` only |
| `/odom` | `nav_msgs/Odometry` | AgrobotDriver, or the EKF with `ekf:=true` | driver: wheel distance + IMU yaw |
| `/wheel/odom` | `nav_msgs/Odometry` | AgrobotDriver | wheels only (yaw from the wheels too), EKF input |
| `/imu/data` | `sensor_msgs/Imu` | AgrobotDriver | frame `imu_link`: orientation, gyro, accelerometer, sensor-data QoS |
| `/clock` | `rosgraph_msgs/Clock` | AgrobotDriver | Webots sim time, every step |
| `/scan` | `sensor_msgs/LaserScan` | AgrobotDriver | frame `front_lidar_link`, 300 rays, 3.0 rad FOV, 0.1–8 m, sensor-data QoS |
| `/joint_states` | `sensor_msgs/JointState` | AgrobotDriver | 4 wheel positions |
| `/tf` | | AgrobotDriver or EKF, robot_state_publisher | `odom → base_link` is dynamic, the rest is static |

All messages are stamped with **Webots simulation time** (`robot.getTime()`), and the
nodes run with `use_sim_time: true`, except `goal_navigator`. Since 2026-10-07 the driver
plugin publishes `/clock` with that time on every step, so the ROS clock of those nodes
follows the simulation. Before that, nothing published `/clock` and their clock stayed at 0.

### Robot parameters

Set in the URDF `<webots><plugin>` block ([agrobot.urdf](agrobot_description/urdf/agrobot.urdf)):

| Property | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `wheelRadius` | 0.22 m | |
| `wheelSeparation` | 0.96 m | geometric track width |
| `wheelSeparationScale` | 1.33 | effective track = 0.96 × 1.33, calibrated for skid-steer slip in turns |
| `publishOdom` | true | driver publishes `/odom` + TF; the launch sets it to false with `ekf:=true` |

Sensors in the PROTO ([agrobot.proto](agrobot_webots/protos/agrobot.proto)):
- `InertialUnit` `imu`, `Gyro` `gyro` and `Accelerometer` `accelerometer` at `imu_link`
  (0.35 m above `base_link`), published together on `/imu/data`
- `Lidar` named `front_lidar` at (0.65, 0, -0.15) from `base_link`, about 0.14 m above the
  floor, so it sees the 0.2 m boxes and 0.3 m crates

### Nav2 configuration (summary)

[config/nav2_params.yaml](agrobot_webots/config/nav2_params.yaml):
- No map. `global_frame: odom` everywhere. Both costmaps are rolling windows (local 4×4 m,
  global 12×12 m, 5 cm cells).
- Layers: `obstacle_layer` (from `/scan`) + `inflation_layer` (radius 0.7 m).
- Footprint 1.2 × 1.12 m (chassis length × outer wheel width).
- Planner: NavFn. Controller: Regulated Pure Pursuit, 0.4 m/s, rotate-to-heading on.
- Goal tolerance: 0.15 m / 0.3 rad.
- Limits (velocity_smoother): 0.5 m/s forward, 0.3 m/s reverse, 1.0 rad/s.

## Running (Gazebo, earlier work)

```bash
ros2 launch agrobot_gazebo simulation.launch.py   # obstacle_arena_world.sdf + spawn + bridge
ros2 launch vineyard_gazebo_world small.launch.py # vineyard world (spawn the robot separately)
ros2 launch agrobot_description spawn_agrobot.launch.py
```

In Gazebo, the robot uses the `gz-sim-diff-drive-system` plugin and the tall `lidar_link`
`gpu_lidar` from the same URDF. The Webots-only parts of the URDF (`<webots>` block,
`front_lidar_link`) don't affect Gazebo.

## Known issues

- **Odometry drift.** Skid-steer wheels slip sideways in turns, and the encoders can't
  see it. Expect about 0.3 m position error per goal and about 0.4 m after a round trip.
  The EKF (`ekf:=true`) doesn't remove this: slip is invisible to wheels and IMU alike.
  Fix: a global reference (VSLAM, SLAM, GPS) publishing `map → odom`.
- **`odom` is relative to the spawn point.** Goals don't refer to fixed world positions.
  Moving the spawn pose in the `.wbt` moves the whole goal frame.
- **Orphan Nav2 processes.** If you kill `ros2 launch` with SIGKILL, leftover nodes (e.g.
  `lifecycle_manager`) deactivate the next run's nodes. Before relaunching, run:
  `pkill -9 -f nav2_`
- **World/PROTO version mismatch.** `obstacle_arena.wbt` is `R2023a`, the PROTO is
  `R2025a`. It loads in the installed Webots, but Webots may ask to convert the world.
- **`agrobot_control` won't run as is.** `obstacle_avoidance.py` and
  `stability_monitor.py` sit in the package root, not in the `agrobot_control/` Python
  module, so the `obstacle_avoidance` entry point can't import them. `stability_monitor`
  has no entry point. Fix: move both into `agrobot_control/agrobot_control/` and add the
  missing entry point.
- **`stability_simulation.launch.py`** uses the relative world path
  `agrobot_gazebo/stability_test_world.sdf`, so it only works when started from the repo
  root.
- **`[Errno 17] File exists: .../meshes/chassis.stl` on `colcon build`.** A workspace built
  with `--symlink-install` before the chassis mesh moved into `agrobot_webots/meshes/`
  (2026-10-06) keeps an old link in `install/` to `agrobot_description`'s mesh, and colcon
  won't replace it. Run once from the workspace root, then rebuild:
  `rm install/agrobot_webots/share/agrobot_webots/meshes/chassis.stl`. If the build still
  fails, or after switching branches or between builds with and without
  `--symlink-install`, clean the package: `rm -rf build/agrobot_webots install/agrobot_webots`.
- **Committed `__pycache__/` files.** Add `__pycache__/` to `.gitignore` and `git rm --cached` them.

## Next steps

1. Test `ekf:=true` in Webots, then a global reference with a `map` frame: RTAB-Map with
   the RGB-D camera (plan in [claude/estudo_vslam.md](claude/estudo_vslam.md)) or
   slam_toolbox with the lidar.
2. Move the Nav2 setup to the vineyard world (rows, longer distances).
3. Fix the `agrobot_control` package layout. Decide whether the reactive avoider is still
   needed alongside Nav2.
4. Fill in `package.xml` descriptions and licenses.
